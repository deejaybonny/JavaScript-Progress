        <h2>LECTURE: Values and Variables</h2>
            <p>1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
                assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
            </p> 

        <p> 2. Log their values to the console </p>

        <h2>LECTURE: let, const and var</h2>
            <p>1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
                countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)</p>
            <p>2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
                change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
            </p> 

    <p>3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens</p>

            1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
                then how many people would live in each half?
        </p>
    <p>
            2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
    </p>
        <p>
            3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
            Finland?
        </p>
    <p>
        4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
            have less people than the average country?
    </p>
        <p>
            5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
            which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
            people speak portuguese'
        </p>

        <p>   
            1. Recreate the 'description' variable from the last assignment, this time
            using the template literal syntax
        </p>
